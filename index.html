 <h3>Short Intro</h3>
 <br>
 <p>I have had a keen interest in sport from a young age, participating and spectating in a variety of sports. My main passion throughout my life has been football, where I have played for many teams such as Wolverhampton Wanderers youth, Dudley Lions, and Headington Amateurs. Thus, providing me with a depth of knowledge and understanding of the technicalities within football. The combination of my interests for sport and science led me to look into the area of sport science as a career choice and to apply for Sport and Exercise Science at Oxford Brookes University. After graduating I took a keen interest into the performance analysis sector where I have 3 yearsâ€™ experience within elite football.</p>
